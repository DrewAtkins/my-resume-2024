# HTML/CSS Resume Project

This project is a demonstration of creating a resume using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate a mock image of a resume, which is located in the `Images` folder within the repository.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the resume.
- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles that are applied to the HTML to style the resume.

The resume is divided into two main sections, each represented by a column. The left column contains personal information and skills, while the right column contains work experience and education.

## Running the Project

To view the resume, simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## Template

Please feel free to use this as a template if you'd like to create your own resume (Although the insight image might not help :))
